# **Epitech Currency API**

## **Version**

v1.0.0

## **Tech choice**

This API is a NodeJS based application.

Why NodeJS? For this API we used a library that partially wraps GitHub API, this library is in Node JS, so here is why we used node js.

Node JS allows us to use thread and async op√©ration very easily.
